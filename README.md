#Task
Create an app that has one button. When the button is pressed, the current temperature in Houston Texas is shown in a text field. By current temperature, we mean the temperature when we run your app.

# Your comments or assumptions

In order to complete it, I used openweatherapi and parsed the JSON data retured for Houston to get the 
current temperature. I have also converted the temperature from kelvin to celsius before displaying it
in a text field.
